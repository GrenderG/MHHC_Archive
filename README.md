# Monster Hunter Hunting Card Archive

[WORK IN PROGRESS] Archive for all Monster Hunter Hunting Card cards. 


## What is this?

The purpose of this repository is to eventually have all cards (and other related material) from this game properly scanned / archived in good quality.

## Current status

At this moment all cards from the first 7 base sets are scanned, although in very low quality. Base set 8 is completely missing and several Special / Promotional cards are also missing. I have around 300-400 cards myself I want to properly scan in the near future.

## Downloading

You can download a .zip containing this entire repository [here](https://github.com/GrenderG/MHHC_Archive/archive/refs/heads/master.zip).

## Contributing

There are several ways to contribute:

1. If you have cards yourself, you can scan them (ideally at 1200ppp and 2858x4086, but even a good photo is better than nothing!) and share them with me or upload them yourself via Pull Request. 
2. If you have cards you don't want anymore or simply want me to scan them, feel free to ship them to me (I don't mind buying them for a reasonable price), I will cover shipping costs if needed.
3. Donating so I can keep buying missing cards in order to scan them (through Ko-Fi for example [https://ko-fi.com/grender](https://ko-fi.com/grender)).
